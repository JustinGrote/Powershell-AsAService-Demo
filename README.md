# Powershell-AsAService-Demo
A demonstration repository for several of the ways to run Powershell As A Service (Azure Automation, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

## Getting Started
[![Launch Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/images/launchcloudshell.png "Launch Cloud Shell")](https://shell.azure.com/powershell)
1. Open a Local Powershell Core (6.1) Terminal or use Cloud Shell
3. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/JustinGrote/Powershell-AsAService-Demo.git`
4. Change to the repository and run `.\demoscript.ps1`

I hope to eventually make this a PSKoans exercise.
